# PassPix

This my first Flutter and Andriod Application Project.

After starting out following an online tutorial I found myself bored with the concept of the app. I was inspired by having to change my password so frequently in work I wanted a way to create secure passwords without needing to keep them in a plain text file to have any chance in remembering them.
This lead me to the concept of PassPix, an application that takes images from your gallery and uses the byte code as a key to generate complex passwords that are repeatable.
Remembering what image I use to sign in for me was far simpler and by choosing that image it will always generate the same password. When it comes time to change I just choose a different image.
